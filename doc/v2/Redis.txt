QIS v2.0 Switch Memcached to Redis
==================================

Redis server

versions - 3.0+ preferred
  - RHEL 6.5 has Redis v2.4.10 in EPEL
  - Latency monitoring added in v2.8.13
  - LRU in 2.4 subject to large latency spikes, fixed in 2.8 and late 2.6
  - LRU unbounded memory bug fixed in 2.6.15 / 2.8
  - LRU algorithm improved again in 3.0

config - LRU mode, memory limit
  - http://redis.io/topics/lru-cache
  - redis.conf - maxmemory 100mb, allkeys-lru policy (nope! see below)
  - Redis 3.0 preferred over 2.8 for LRU algorithm
  - 5 samples probably OK in 3.0, can test 10 (see cache misses stats)
  - redis.conf - maxmemory-samples 5
32 / 64 bit
  - 32 bit version is limited to 4GB RAM
  - use multiple instances in preference to the database number
  - relax the fsync setting

Probably 2 instances:
  - 1 for LRU cache with images, memory limited
  - 1 for data store, persistent, unlimited (no, some limit + LRU)
  - But complicated to administer, code for (2 connections), and cluster

Or 1 instance:
  - Set long TTL / expiry on images
  - Reset the TTL when image is retrieved (combine these 2 into 1 call?)
  - Do NOT set an expiry on the data items
  - Use memory limit with volatile-lru policy, evicts only items with TTL set

Redis client
  - redis-py

Things to note:

- Is the Redis client thread safe?
- Look at http://redis.io/topics/admin for things like Linux kernel params

QIS uses of the cache (not including cache_manager itself):

- clear all (for unit tests)
  - beware if using 2 instances/databases
- detection of up/down status
- detection of % full (when memory limit in force)
- global lock - db creation (atomic add)
- global lock - image generation (atomic add)
- get/set image src --> image ID
- get/set image key --> binary image object     } combine into single hash?
- get/set image metadata key --> metadata dict  } maybe not, docs say hash values are strings
- cache search for base images
  - ID + format + (width>=x || none) + (height>=y || none)
  - ordered by size (no need?), limited to 100 (no need if can pull back metadata only)
  - 100 limit can go if we also consider that base cannot be a tile (check this assumption)
    and filter it redis-side
- cache search for image variants
  - ID
  - no result limit
- time limited flag - pyramid generation complete (10 min timeout)
- get/set user+folder --> calculated permissions tuple, 3600 sec expiry
- unit tests
  - slot mechanism tests can be deleted
  - hash collision / integrity check tests can be deleted

Memcached quirks that can be deleted:

- Cache tracking table in Postgres, Python model and SQLAlchemy code
- Cache tracking database and Postgres user
  - Update install documentation, tuning documentation
  - Remove from Dockerfiles, Docker init scripts
  - Remove from AWS AMIs, AWS init scripts
  - Reduce Postgres max connections (maybe)
  - Remove from base_settings and local_settings
- Multiple slots mechanism
- Self integrity checks

Things to test:

- Redis client thread safety
- Does the Redis client re-connect automatically after Redis re-start?

Redis quirks:

- If we enable persistence, fsync can be off, snapshots required but how long will
  a 40GB DB take to write out? Is snapshot writing a lightweight task?
- Large DBs (several GB+) will take many minutes to load on startup,
  during which time Redis is unavailable
- We would therefore need a separate DB (persistence disabled) for startup lock flags
  - and maybe a temporary image store while the main DB is starting up?
- Or, we just disable persistence
